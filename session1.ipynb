For each topic within the course, the plan is to begin by watching a brief <span style=\"color:red\">video</span> to gain a high-level understanding of the techniques. This is then supplemented with <span style=\"color:red\">online documentation</span> and hands-on <span style=\"color:red\">exercises</span> using data extracted from OneTick to deepen your knowledge. Please work through the course at your own pace and by making full use of the exercises contained in this notebook.
